# How to Employ Linear Regression from Sci-Kit Learn

LInear regressions are models of the form:
    
$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x1 + \beta_2 x2 + ... + \epsilon$$
    
where $$x_n1, ... , x_n$$ are my figgerent features
    
To employ this model in sklearn, I need to first import it: 


```python
x=1
x+x
2
```


```python

```
